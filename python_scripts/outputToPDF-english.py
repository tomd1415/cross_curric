<h2>Further Development of Cross-Curriculum Links</h2>
<p>To enhance cross-curricular links further, project-based learning can be introduced where students integrate computing skills with their English assignments. For instance, they might develop a digital magazine or a blog that showcases their creative writing, incorporating multimedia elements such as podcasts, videos, or interactive graphics. Encouraging students to use digital tools for research, analysis, and presentation of their English literature assignments will not only deepen their understanding but also solidify their digital literacy skills. Collaborative projects that combine coding with storytelling or that employ digital platforms for the publication and critique of work could be particularly engaging and educational.</p>
