<h2>Further Development of Cross-Curriculum Links</h2>
<p>To expand on these cross-curricular connections, additional focus can be placed on projects that integrate digital tools for social projects in the PSHE curriculum. For instance, students could engage in creating digital storyboards that outline their understanding of community and individual responsibilities. These could then be shared with wider audiences to foster a greater sense of digital citizenship. Furthermore, integration of coding activities that require students to solve problems related to real-world scenarios, like creating apps for time management or emotional journaling, can make learning more relevant and engaging.</p>
